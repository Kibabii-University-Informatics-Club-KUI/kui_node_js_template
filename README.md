<br />

> Some of these packages are not used in the project at all. But I included them just for my own reference so I can use them when needed.

<br />

## Dev Dependancies

- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

<br />

## Installation Steps

Make required changes inside .env file and simply run
`npm install`

> Whenever you want to migrate database tables, open  **.env** file and set `MIGRATE_DB=TRUE` and then run the development server. Once all tables are migrated, stop the server and update **.env** file back to `MIGRATE_DB=FALSE`. While doing migration, if the table already exists, it will not do any modifications in that table.
> 
- Run development server - `npm run dev`
- Run production server - `npm run start`

And then use any files at **/API/\*.rest** inside VS Code using [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension to test the API endpoints. All the endpoints are listed in these **_.rest_** files.

or simply use Postman tool to test all the API endpoints.

<br />

> Make sure to remove all unnecessary packages from **_package.json_** file before deploying to production server
